# Debug Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **app.js - Deprecated File Conflict**
- **Issue**: Deprecated file still contained active form handling code that could conflict with index.html
- **Fix**: Updated comments to clearly mark as deprecated and recommend removal

### 2. **index.html - Broken Image Fallback**
- **Issue**: SVG fallback for missing images was truncated and broken
- **Fix**: Replaced with proper fallback div with user icon and styling

### 3. **scripts/gen_feed.py - Hardcoded URL**
- **Issue**: Environment variable had placeholder URL
- **Fix**: Updated to use proper Netlify URL as default

### 4. **google-apps-script.js - Field Mismatch**
- **Issue**: Form uses "profession" field but script expected "occupation"
- **Fix**: Added fallback to handle both field names

### 5. **updates-fetch.js - Poor Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Minimal error handling and user feedback
- **Fix**: Enhanced error messages and fallback content display

## Remaining Recommendations:

### 1. **Remove Deprecated Files**
```bash
rm app.js  # This file is no longer needed
```

### 2. **Add Missing Images**
- Check that all images referenced in `alumni-images.json` exist in the `images/` folder
- Add fallback images or remove missing entries from the JSON

### 3. **Test Google Apps Script Integration**
- Verify the Google Apps Script endpoint is working
- Test form submissions with and without photos
- Check directory loading functionality

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- Consider lazy loading for carousel images
- Add service worker for offline functionality
- Optimize image sizes in the `images/` folder

### 5. **Security Improvements**
- Add CSP headers via netlify.toml
- Validate file uploads more strictly
- Add rate limiting for form submissions
